            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Toshifumi Kamino. I have both Norwegian and Japanese roots. I went to a vocational school in Japan where I studied violin making and repair. Skills such as making and repairing violin, viola and cello were acquired through my studies.<br/><br/>After graduation, I moved to Norway and went to Folkeh√∏yskole and studied hunting and fishing. Video editing and web design are two areas that I am very interested in.
Using Wordpress, I have written a personal blog. This is something I enjoy doing, and I have a great interest in IT-related work in general. On the blog I post pictures and videos, which I edit, and I have great motivation to develop and learn more about these fields. I have used Cyberlink as editing software.</p>
