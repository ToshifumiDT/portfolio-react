  Hi! I'm Toshifumi Kamino — a creative individual with both Norwegian and Japanese roots. My journey began in Japan, where I studied violin making and repair at a vocational school, gaining hands-on skills in crafting and restoring violins, violas, and cellos.<br/><br/>

  After graduating, I moved to Norway and attended a Folkehøyskole to explore my interest in hunting and fishing. Over time, my passion shifted toward digital creativity — especially web design and video editing.<br/><br/>

  I launched a personal blog using WordPress to share photos and videos, which I edit myself. This sparked a deep interest in IT and digital tools, motivating me to pursue further learning. I started with Cyberlink and later advanced to Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, gaining experience in basic editing, color grading, and smooth transitions.<br/><br/>

  In 2024, I joined a course called Digitale Talenter, where I deepened my knowledge of web development. I began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and progressed to modern frameworks like React and Next.js.<br/><br/>

  In parallel, I’ve been teaching myself 3D modeling using Blender. From creating simple shapes to building complex character models, this journey continues to inspire my curiosity and creativity.<br/><br/>

  I'm passionate about combining technology and creativity — and I'm excited to keep building, learning, and sharing my work with the world.
